## Obligatory

You are wasting my time. Most of us are investors so let's be straight: if this
project does not get the shit done as it promised, I will sell all my
double-figure NFTs and leave.  You waste all the golden time to promote
yourself, sad to see this.

The Lamborghini Huracan EVO RWD is the cheapest Lamborghini you can buy, but it
still costs $208,571. In turn about 69 Eth. If we all delist and repost for 69
Eth it will cost 1 Lamborghini each to join into our project. Weâ€™re doing this
all wrong.
